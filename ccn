                          comprehensive anti-ragging policy to ensure a safe and <br>
                          respectful environment for all students.Here’s an overview<br>
                          of what such a policy. The policy defines ragging as any act<br>
                          that causes physical or psychological harm to students. This<br>
                          can include harassment, humiliation, or any form of bullying.<br>
                          SCET enforces a strict no-ragging policy, which means that any<br>
                          form of ragging is not tolerated. The institution maintains a <br>
                          zero-tolerance stance to ensure that students are protected.<br>
                          Preventive Measures Awareness Programs. The college conducts<br>
                          awareness campaigns and orientations for students and staff <br>
                          about the ill effects of ragging and the importance of <br>
                          maintaining a safe environment. Rules and Regulations Clear<br>
                          rules are established and communicated to students at the<br>
                          beginning of each academic year, outlining what constitutes <br>
                          ragging and the consequences of engaging in such behavior.
